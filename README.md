# NLP project

### Description
 
  -In this project, the script receives an txt file in the format of an exported conversation from whatsapp and then, shows two word clouds with the most commom words of each participant of the conversation.
 
### Goals

  -Build a simple website the in the first page has section with a tutorial of how to export a whatsapp conversation and after this section, an input file that receives a txt file and sends to the app.py script and then, the script will return an image that needs to bee shown to the user in the same page or in another(you choose).

  -Add the option "download" for the resultant image

### What we already have?

  -A functional file(python/app.py) that generates the word cloud.

  -A template of how the site will be (it is just a basic template, you can suggest changes).

### What we need?

  -To create a website that can run the app.py file, some people suggested to me the use of flask but if you can do this in php will be great too.

### Running example

  -You can copy the files from the "example" folder to a local folder on you pc, and the run the script python, that will generate a wordCloud inside your folder. If you want to try with your own whatsapp talk, change the values of "Name1" and "Name2" in the python scripts, add stopwords of your language in the "stopwords_example" file and replace the "talk_example" with your talk.
